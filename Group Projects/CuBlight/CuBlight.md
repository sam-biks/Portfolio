## Game Concept
Cu Blight is fast-paced action roguelike isometric twin-stick shooter. Move, shoot, and dash your way through randomly selected rooms, gaining items along the way, with the goal of destroying everthing that isn't the perfect shape (a cube).
## What I Did
### Procedural Content Generation
My first task was implementing the random world generation. This took the form of generating layers of 3x3 rooms and populating those rooms with predesigned and balanced encounters. This was repated a number of times based on which level the player was on. Each level was joined together with teleporter rooms.
### User Interface
I implemented most of the user interface for the game including the map of the level in the upper right hand corner and the health/dash bars in the upper left.
### Player Controller
I assisted in implementing certain aspects of the player controller, including the dash mechanic and movement.
### Tech Lead
As Tech Lead I was in charge of making and testing weekly builds, hosting tech meetings, coordinating with members of the tech team, and compiling weekly/monthly changelogs.
## What I Learned
This project was my first time using Unity and it taught me a lot about how to use it, and also how commerical game engines work in general.  
I learned a lot about communication and being a team leader, especially across disciplines. I had worked as a team leader in the past but those teams consisted of only programmers.
